My solutions to [Advent of Code 2018][1] in Common Lisp. I've been reading a
few books on Common Lisp and playing around a little bit here and there, but
this is my first real code with Common Lisp. It's very likely that most of it is
not of very high quality, but Advent of Code is a good way to get started on
using a language.
