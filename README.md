My solutions to [Advent of Code 2018][1] in Common Lisp. I've been reading a
few books on Common Lisp and playing around a little bit here and there, but
besides [Advent of Code 2017][2] I haven't written any real code in Common Lisp.
It's very likely that most of it is not of very high quality, but Advent of Code
is a good way to get started on using a language.
